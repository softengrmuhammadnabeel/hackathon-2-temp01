# 🎨 UI/UX Hackathon 2 - GIAIC 2024 🖥️

## 🚀 About This Project

This project was created as part of **Hackathon 2** from the **Governor IT Initiative Challenge (GIAIC)**. The challenge was to develop a **pixel-perfect, responsive UI/UX** based on the design provided in **Figma**. The website features a complete **e-commerce platform** with components such as a **landing page, product listings, wishlist, and cart functionalities**. 

I took the Figma design provided by the hackathon organizers and translated it into code using **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**. The design is fully responsive, ensuring that the website functions smoothly on all device sizes.
